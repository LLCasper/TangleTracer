TangleTracer is only an experimental ray tracing platform based on the book named "Ray tracing from the Ground Up" written by kevin suffern. I think this book is the best tortuial for anyone new to ray tracing or CG rendering. Since the writer didn't release a complete demo program covers the whole book until now, it may be causing troubles when we want to run some demos directly.
Fortunately, most coding materials about the book can be downloaded from the official website http://www.raytracegroundup.com, then what we have to do is just to put them together. 
It sounds easy, right? In fact it's a bit of difficulty. Thus I decided to rebuild all parts of this project, the final one should be able to run all examples on the original book at least. Furthermore, the new project must be flexible enough to the cutting-edge like rendering techniques.
This project used wxwidget as its GUI part, but I'm not familiar to that. To save time I used Qt framework instead of Wx as the GUI interface. Is it Ok without GUI programming? Answer is obvious YES at current stage. However, an intuitive user interface is easy to use and understand. So it is necessary to compile with Qt framework. I use Qt4.7.3 compiled under the Visual Studio 2010, a Visual Studio Add-in for Qt is required, you can get them on Qt's official website.
Certainly you can extract any code from this project just like what I have done for Kevin Suffern:) whatever you need. I'm sure it's very easy to do that.

This project is based on the code from Kevin Suffern, and revised by mp77. I have test all of them before they were push to Git. Some original statements can't pass compiling when I test all code in book, and I have make them repaired, but I can't ensure all of them are correct logically. At least they all can pass the compiling and looks not too bad~
